# ONCOST Catalog & Quotation App — PRD

## Problem statement (verbatim from user)
> "I have a business catalog PDF, I want the price of each item to be incremented by 50 if the price is below 1000 rs, above 1000 rs it has to be incremented by 100. Can you edit the PDF and share me the updated pdf to download and send to a customer. I have each image to use as a similar digital catalogue. I am fine if not pdf, a .html view is also ok with updated values of price. Should be able to share the quotation as part of ONCOST, and they should see my updated prices, not the list I used."

User clarifications:
1. Prices not static — need control to update
2. Both PDF and HTML output
3. Shareable HTML link under admin control
4. SG is wholesaler, ONCOST is reseller brand
5. Fields: customer name, order/quotation ID, place of order, MOQ

## Personas
- **Admin (ONCOST owner)** — manages catalog, sets margins, creates customer quotations
- **Customer (corporate buyer)** — receives shareable link, views quotation, downloads PDF

## Core requirements

## 2026-06-25 — Categories + Add Product + Professional Quotation Terms
- **Categories CRUD**: New `/admin/categories` page with create/edit/delete/visibility/banner-image upload.
- **Add Product flow**: New "+ Add Product" red button on Products page opens modal with Code, Set type, Description, Supplier price, MOQ, Category dropdown, optional Image upload.
- **Edit Details enhanced**: Existing Edit Details modal now includes a Category dropdown so existing 92 products can be linked.
- **Category filter** on Products page header (All categories / per-category).
- **Quotation PDF**:
  - Updated default dispatch timeline to **10–15 business days**.
  - Payment policy enforced: **50% advance, Bank Transfer (NEFT/RTGS/IMPS) or Account Payee Cheque ONLY — NO Cash/UPI**. Highlighted in an amber callout box.
  - New 10-point **TERMS & CONDITIONS** section (validity, taxes, artwork approval, ±2% tolerance, jurisdiction, force majeure).
- **Existing 92 products and their images: untouched.** All admin-uploaded images remain intact.
- **Backend bug fix**: `POST /api/products` previously returned 500 because Motor mutates the inserted dict with `_id` (ObjectId, not JSON-serializable). Fixed by popping `_id` after insert.
